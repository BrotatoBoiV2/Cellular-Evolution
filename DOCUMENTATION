        Cells objects have been created with natural
        movement and fear of the mouse cursor for predator evasion.

        Given the Cells an energy unit so that they now have life, and capable of dying.
        Now I want to add a Food object so the cells can survive longer.

    22:36
        There are now food objects and they recharge the cells energy.
        Also, when the energy of a cell reaches 20% more energy than 
        the base amount of energy, the cell splits into another cell.
