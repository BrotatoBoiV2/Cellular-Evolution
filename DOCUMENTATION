        Initial creation of the project on local system.

    21:50
        Created the GitHub Repo and merged it 
        with the local version with a starting skeleton.

        The screen renders and can be closed.

    20:04
        Cells objects have been created with natural
        movement and fear of the mouse cursor for predator evasion.

        Given the Cells an energy unit so that they now have life, and capable of dying.
        Now I want to add a Food object so the cells can survive longer.

    22:36
        There are now food objects and they recharge the cells energy.
        Also, when the energy of a cell reaches 20% more energy than 
        the base amount of energy, the cell splits into another cell.

        A code refactor has been done, and more functions have been created
        so the code is a little more modulated and easier to maintain.

        Now the program cleanly exits and stops all processes.

    18:06
        Framerate and DeltaTime has been introduced and movement is now as intended.


# TODO
Noticed food does not always get eaten
Use perlin noise for more natural movement
Minus radius from the position to make it centered
Give a small random offset on birth for a more natural split
Fleeing could be more softer and include a decay for being farther from the mouse
Fleeing can also increase energy usage
Ensure FPS is being applied `self.clock = pg.time.Clock() ; self.clock.tick(60)`
Imports can be cleaned up
Clean up how food is eaten, world should handle it not the cells itself
Grid Partitioning or Quadtrees to help food discovery
Move magic numbers like decay, split threshold and food energy into variables for better evolution
